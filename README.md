**This LMS is my part in a group project titled _"Smart Attendance Management System"_** 

Brief :- 
Smart Attendance Management System is system made using Neural Networks wherein the attendance of the students is marked using facial recoginition. Only the registered students are considered for marking attendance. The system collects the leave data from the database(firebase) and accordingly marks the status of the student.
